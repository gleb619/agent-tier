# Kanban Board

Lightweight planner for `at` implementation tasks. Machine-mutated by `at kanban` only.

* High-level planner only — details live in [`./docs/plans`](./plans).
* The agent **must** move `Status` when taking a task and again when the work is done.
* Rows stay sorted by `ID`; `at kanban add` enforces this mechanically.

## Status Legend

| Status        | Meaning                                                  | Who updates it  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `Backlog`     | Task is defined but not yet started.                     | Planner / agent |
| `In Progress` | An agent is actively working the task.                   | Coding agent    |
| `Blocked`     | Cannot continue until another task or issue is resolved. | Coding agent    |
| `Done`        | Task completed and accepted.                             | Coding agent    |
